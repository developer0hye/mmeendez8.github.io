  - title: "SKYWAY - The WAY to Integration of Autonomous Aircraft in a Shared SKY"
    authors: Gradiant & Boeing Research & Technology-Europe
    description:
      "The global objective of the Galician SkyWay project, which was completed in September 2020, was to design, prototype and test in representative environments 
      a set of advanced technological solutions for the most relevant contingencies in the operations of UAS in non-segregated airspace. 
      Collaborated on solving the problem of loss of separation between aircraft that could increase the risk of collision between them. Developed CNNs models embeddable
      on Nvidia Jetson boards that can automatically detect other drones and aircraft present in the airspace, based on the information obtained through on-board cameras."

  - title: "PRIMARE - Semantic segmentation for crop identification"
    authors: Gradiant
    description:
      "Participated in PRIMARE project, where innovative technological solutions to field inspections linked to EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) were implemented. 
      Gradiant has contributed to this project y developing a video analysis module for semantic segmentation of terrain for crop type identification, and detection
      of elements of interest for farming auditing. Segmentation and detection are achieved using DNN based approaches on multispectral UAV and satellite imagery. 
      The module includes basic image geo-registration capabilities using inertial data, which allows  for automatically locating objects of interest on a 3D map as 
      well as for matching crop types against a database of farm land."

  - title: "Feature construction and classification on Time Series"
    authors: "Master Thesis - Prof. Bruno Ribero - Purdue University"
    description:
      "Collaborated with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in PEGASAS project with the aim of enhance general aviation safety.
      Developed a model which could classify flights in different categories using data obtained from airborne sensors through an
      unsupervised learning stage and an active learning procedure. Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, C, OpenMPI, Java
      <br />Presented in PEGASAS 2017 meeting at Texas A&M University"

  #   description:
  #     "System for musical instruments recognition using NNs with over 10000 audio samples using Fourier Transform and its harmonics
  #     to create the input features. Created our own NN library in Python from scratch."

  # - title: "Corruption simulation in Social Netowrks (Twitter)"
  #   description:
  #     "Analysis using Twitter publics API where we focus in the relations between politicians in the social network. We performed a
  #     Monte Carlo simulation of corruption behavior spreading with the aim of observing how corruption flows starting from some seed
  #     users that were imprisoned or involved in some case."

  # - title: "Flight Safe Android App"
  #   description:
  #     "Guide and developed android app for collecting AHRS data during flights to facilitate the creation of a dataset for future
  #     experiments. This app is used by all pilots and students at that flight from Purdueâ€™s airport."
