  - title: "Feature construction and classification on Time Series"
    authors: "Master Thesis - Prof. Bruno Ribero - Purdue University"
    description:
      "Collaborated with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in PEGASAS project with the aim of enhance general aviation safety.
      Developed a model which could classify flights in different categories using data obtained from airborne sensors through an
      unsupervised learning stage and an active learning procedure. Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, C, OpenMPI, Java
      <br />Presented in PEGASAS 2017 meeting at Texas A&M University"

  - title: "Instrument recognition using Neural Networks"
    description:
      "System for musical instruments recognition using NNs with over 10000 audio samples using Fourier Transform and its harmonics
      to create the input features. Created our own NN library in Python from scratch."

  - title: "Corruption simulation in Social Netowrks (Twitter)"
    description:
      "Analysis using Twitter publics API where we focus in the relations between politicians in the social network. We performed a
      Monte Carlo simulation of corruption behavior spreading with the aim of observing how corruption flows starting from some seed
      users that were imprisoned or involved in some case."

  - title: "Flight Safe Android App"
    description:
      "Guide and developed android app for collecting AHRS data during flights to facilitate the creation of a dataset for future
      experiments. This app is used by all pilots and students at that flight from Purdueâ€™s airport."
