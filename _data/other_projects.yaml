  - title: "Pyodi: Python Object Detection Insights"
    description: 
      "A simple tool for explore your object detection dataset. The goal of this library is to provide simple and intuitive visualizations
       from your dataset and automatically find the best parameters for generating a specific grid of anchors that can fit you data characteristics"

  - title: "Feature construction and classification on Time Series"
    description:
      "Collaborated with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in PEGASAS project with the aim of enhance general aviation safety.
      Developed a model which could classify flights in different categories (using data obtained from airborne sensors) through an
      unsupervised learning stage and an active learning procedure. Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, C, OpenMPI, Java
      <br />Presented in PEGASAS 2017 meeting at Texas A&M University"

  - title: "Corruption simulation in Social Networks (Twitter)"
    description:
      "Analysis using Twitter public API where we focused in understanding how politicians relate in the social network. We performed a
      Monte Carlo simulation of corruption behavior spreading with the aim of observing how corruption flows starting from some seed
      users that were imprisoned or involved in some case."
